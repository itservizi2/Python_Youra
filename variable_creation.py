Task 1
Create variables that describe the car - model, color, year, number of doors. Place values in them.
Then change the color of the car by assigning a new value to the corresponding variable in the code below.
Display all values. When creating variable names, use appropriate words.

Create variables that will contain people's ages. Also create a variable that will store the number of people.
Calculate and display the average age of a person based on the ages of these five people. If you donâ€™t know
the formula for calculating the arithmetic average, use the Internet to search for information.
When creating variable names, use appropriate words.
'''
# Initial variables
car_model = "Toyota Camry"
car_color = "Red"
car_year = 2020
car_number_of_doors = 4

# Display initial values
print("Initial Car Details:")
print("Model:", car_model)
print("Color:", car_color)
print("Year:", car_year)
print("Number of doors:", car_number_of_doors)

# Change the color of the car
car_color = "Blue"

# Display updated values
print("\nUpdated Car Details:")
print("Model:", car_model)
print("Color:", car_color)
print("Year:", car_year)
print("Number of doors:", car_number_of_doors)

Task 2
Create variables that will contain people's ages. Also create a variable that will store the number of people. 
Calculate and display the average age of a person based on the ages of these five people. 
When creating variable names, use appropriate words.
'''
# Variables containing people's ages
age_person_1 = 25
age_person_2 = 30
age_person_3 = 22
age_person_4 = 28
age_person_5 = 35

# Variable storing the number of people
number_of_people = 5

# Calculate the average age
total_age = age_person_1 + age_person_2 + age_person_3 + age_person_4 + age_person_5
average_age = total_age / number_of_people

# Display the average age
print("\nThe average age of the people is:", average_age)
